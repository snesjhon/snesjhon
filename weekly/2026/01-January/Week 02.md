Moving ahead with deploying an ios app. Since it's not so simple just do it, and it takes little to no effort to get an idea out. Why wouldn't I just do it? 

It's not going to cost me anything.... besides the time and the apple developer price. But worth just having something out there

This one has the problem `Permutation in string` and it kicked my butt because although I understood it initially. I didn't understand it as I got down the use cases. But I should be proud of myself for getting closer than I have been previously.
