Well, I think the ios app is going great, but probably need to focus on Algos for the next couple of weeks and come back to ios if needed. Just Don't want to fall behind ya know.

One another note, the idea of having a specialized keyboard layout for coding has always been a dream and I think now it's happening.

Moving ahead with deploying an ios app. Since it's not so simple just do it, and it takes little to no effort to get an idea out. Why wouldn't I just do it? 

It's not going to cost me anything.... besides the time and the apple developer price. But worth just having something out there

This one has the problem `Permutation in string` and it kicked my butt because although I understood it initially. I didn't understand it as I got down the use cases. But I should be proud of myself for getting closer than I have been previously.
