Starting off the day with a good amount of breakdowns on what's suppose to be an easy questions: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/

But I personally found it more confusing than not. I think it makes more sense to continue learning about the different strategies on tackling this kind of issue. 

On the other hand [[00-complete-dsa-path#Days 1-4 Arrays & Strings]] was rather straight forward with the other problems. They were ones that I've covered before but now I'm a lot better incorporated in knowing how they work.

Today I created quite a few things after yesterday's head bashing with trying to answer [maximum-distinct](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k)  questions. It was overall very frustrating but after getting the overall mental model then ai think it made more sense. 

I created [[Drawing 2025-12-30 11.53.40.excalidraw]] which allowed me to understand the overall mental model better.
