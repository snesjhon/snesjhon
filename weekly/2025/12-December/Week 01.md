Today I created quite a few things after yesterday's head bashing with trying to answer [maximum-distinct](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code/sliding-window/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k)  questions. It was overall very frustrating but after getting the overall mental model then ai think it made more sense. 

I created [[Drawing 2025-12-30 11.53.40.excalidraw]] which allowed me to understand the overall mental model better.
