#concept/greedy-approach 

- Greedy approach means making the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to a globally optimal solution.


### Simple heuristic:
- If the problem asks "find the minimum/maximum/best X" and you're deciding whether to include/exclude elements → likely greedy
- If the problem asks "compute Y for each element" with no optimization → likely just a data structure technique
