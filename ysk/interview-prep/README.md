# Interview Preparation Hub

> Your comprehensive guide to DSA + System Design mastery.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the Master Guide**: [`00-master-interview-guide.md`](./00-master-interview-guide.md)
2. **Review the Detailed Paths**:
   - [DSA Learning Path](../dsa/00-complete-dsa-path.md)
   - [System Design Learning Path](../system-design/00-complete-system-design-path.md)
3. **Follow the integrated schedule**: Study both in parallel from Week 1

## 🎯 The Integrated Approach

This hub orchestrates both DSA and System Design study:

### Time Allocation
- **DSA**: 60% of study time (18-24 hrs/week full-time)
- **System Design**: 40% of study time (12-16 hrs/week full-time)

### Timeline
- **Month 1**: DSA Fundamentals + SD Components
- **Month 2**: DSA Patterns + Simple Systems
- **Month 3**: Advanced DSA + Complex Systems
- **Month 4**: Mastery & Refinement

## 📅 How to Use This Hub

### Week 1 Setup
- [ ] Read `00-master-interview-guide.md` completely
- [ ] Skim both DSA and System Design paths
- [ ] Set up LeetCode account (Premium recommended)
- [ ] Install drawing tool (Excalidraw, draw.io)
- [ ] Create simple tracking system (spreadsheet, Notion, etc.)

### Daily Routine

**Full-Time (6-8 hours/day)**:
- Morning (3-4 hrs): DSA practice
- Afternoon (2-3 hrs): System Design study
- Evening (30-60 mins): Review and planning

**Part-Time (3-4 hours/day)**:
- Mon/Wed/Fri: 2 hrs DSA + 1 hr SD
- Tue/Thu: 1 hr DSA + 2 hrs SD
- Weekend: Balanced mix + review

### Weekly Check-In

Every Sunday, review:
- DSA: Problems solved, patterns learned, what's confusing?
- System Design: Systems designed, concepts learned, gaps?
- Overall: Hit time targets? Energy level? Adjustments needed?

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Study Both in Parallel**: Don't wait to "finish" one before starting the other
2. **60/40 Time Split**: More time on DSA, but don't neglect System Design
3. **Depth Over Breadth**: Understand 150 problems deeply > know 300 superficially
4. **Active Learning**: Code every solution, draw every architecture
5. **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit problems and systems regularly
6. **Consistency > Intensity**: 6 focused hours > 12 distracted hours
