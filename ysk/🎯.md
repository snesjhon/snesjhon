## 📚 Study Approach

### When Learning a New Problem
1. **Read problem** - Understand constraints, examples
2. **Identify pattern** - Which pattern applies?
3. **Check concept page** - Review [[concept]] if needed
4. **Attempt solution** - Code it myself first
5. **Compare & learn** - Check my solution notes
6. **Add to pattern** - Update pattern progress page

### When Preparing for Interviews
1. Start at [[questions]] master index
2. Review 5-7 pattern pages (focus on weak areas)
3. Practice 2-3 problems per pattern
4. Time myself - aim for < 20 min per medium
5. Explain solutions out loud

## 🔧 Useful Patterns

### Hash Map Patterns
- **Complement:** [[001-two-sum]]
- **Grouping:** [[049-group-anagrams]]
- **Frequency:** Many counting problems

### Sliding Window Patterns
- **Variable size:** [[003-longest-substring]]
- **Fixed size:** [[239-sliding-window-maximum]]

### Array Patterns
- **Sorting + greedy:** [[056-merge-intervals]]
- **Two pointers:** Many array problems

## 📝 Quick Reference

### Complexity Targets
| Approach       | Time       | Space     | When to Use   |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Brute Force    | O(n²)      | O(1)      | Learning only |
| Hash Map       | O(n)       | O(n)      | Fast lookups  |
| Two Pointers   | O(n)       | O(1)      | Sorted arrays |
| Sliding Window | O(n)       | O(1)-O(n) | Subarrays     |
| Sorting        | O(n log n) | O(1)-O(n) | Order matters |

### Common Optimizations
- O(n²) → O(n): Use hash map
- O(n²) → O(n): Use sliding window
- O(n²) → O(n log n): Sort first
- O(n) → O(1): Two pointers (if sorted)

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Meta-Skills
1. **Pattern recognition** is more important than memorization
2. **Draw it out** - Visual thinking helps
3. **Start simple** - Brute force first, optimize later
4. **Time yourself** - Build interview speed
5. **Explain out loud** - Teaching = understanding

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Jumping to code before understanding
- Not considering edge cases
- Forgetting to analyze complexity
- Not testing with examples
- Giving up too quickly on hard problems

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. Better to practice 1 problem daily than 10 in one day!
