# Array Problems

#concept/arrays

Problems focused on array manipulation, traversal, and algorithms.

**Core Concept:** [[arrays]]

---

## Mastery Levels

### ✅ Understood & Confident
- [[001-two-sum]] - Hash map with arrays
- [[049-group-anagrams]] - Array of strings, grouping
- [[056-merge-intervals]] - 2D arrays, sorting

### 🔄 Practicing
- [[003-longest-substring]] - String as array of characters
- [[239-sliding-window-maximum]] - Window over array

---

## Common Array Patterns

### Pattern 1: Two Pointers
See [[two-pointers]] for details.

### Pattern 2: Sliding Window
See [[sliding-window]] for details.

### Pattern 3: Sorting + Greedy
**Example:** [[056-merge-intervals]]
- Sort array first
- Make greedy decisions in order
- Often O(n log n) due to sorting

### Pattern 4: Hash Map Optimization
**Example:** [[001-two-sum]]
- Replace O(n²) nested loops
- Store seen elements
- O(n) time, O(n) space

## Techniques to Master

### In-Place Modification
- Two pointers (fast/slow)
- Partition algorithms
- Removing duplicates

### Interval Problems
- Sorting by start/end time
- Merging overlapping ranges
- Scheduling problems

### Subarray Problems
- Sliding window for contiguous
- Prefix sums for range queries
- Kadane's algorithm for max sum
