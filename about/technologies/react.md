# React

#tech/frontend

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, my primary frontend framework.

## My Experience

### Projects Using React
- [[2024-unified-analytics]] - Component library and analytics platform
- [[2024-performance-optimization]] - Performance profiling and optimization
- [[2024-promise-debugging]] - Promise lifecycle and error handling

### What I've Built With It
- Internal component libraries
- Complex analytics dashboards
- High-performance visualizations for large datasets
- Migration systems from legacy components

## Key Areas of Expertise

### Component Architecture
From [[2024-unified-analytics]]:
- Designing component libraries as "source of truth"
- Creating extensible components for multiple teams
- Migration patterns from legacy to modern architecture
- Internal library design and adoption strategies

### Performance Optimization
From [[2024-performance-optimization]]:
- Profiling React applications at scale
- Identifying render performance issues
- Optimization for large datasets (10k+ nodes)
- Using React DevTools for production debugging

### Production Debugging
From [[2024-promise-debugging]]:
- Understanding component lifecycle
- Promise handling in React components
- Error boundary patterns
- Production debugging techniques

## Technical Deep Dives

### Component Library Design
- Source of truth pattern
