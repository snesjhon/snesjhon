# Balancing Technical Debt vs. New Features

#interview-question #technical-debt

## The Question

"How do you balance technical debt with new feature development?" or "Tell me about a time you had to make tradeoffs between code quality and delivery speed"

## Primary Example

*To be filled with specific experience*

### Template for Future Use

**The Situation**
- What was the technical debt?
- What was the feature pressure?
- What were the constraints?

**The Decision**
- How did you evaluate the tradeoff?
- What did you choose and why?
- Who was involved?

**The Outcome**
- How did it work out?
- What would you do differently?

## Key Points to Consider

### When Technical Debt Is Worth It
- Time-sensitive opportunity
- Exploration/validation phase
- Clear plan to address later
- Isolated to one area

### When to Prioritize Quality
- Core infrastructure
- Security/compliance
- High-traffic paths
- Complex business logic

### How to Make the Call
- Impact on future velocity
- Cost of fixing later vs. now
- Team capacity and expertise
- Business priorities

## Follow-up Questions to Prepare For

### "How do you prevent technical debt from accumulating?"
- Regular refactoring time
- Code review standards
- Documentation of known issues
- Tracking and prioritization

### "How do you convince stakeholders to prioritize tech debt?"
- Show velocity impact
- Quantify maintenance cost
- Risk of outages/bugs
- Developer experience impact

### "Give an example of tech debt you chose to take on"
- *Add specific example when you have one*

### "How do you track technical debt?"
- *Add your approach when you have concrete examples*
