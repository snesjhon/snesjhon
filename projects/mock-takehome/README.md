# Healthcare Platform Take-Home Exercise

**Total Time: 115 minutes**

Welcome! This exercise is designed to assess your technical decision-making, communication skills, and implementation abilities. You'll work on a feature for a healthcare platform that helps medical practices manage patient data and compliance requirements.

## Overview

You will complete two parts:
- **Part 1 (40 minutes)**: Design Document
- **Part 2 (70 minutes)**: Implementation

## Context

You're working on a healthcare platform that helps medical practices manage patient records. The platform needs to comply with HIPAA regulations, which require detailed audit logs of who accessed patient data and when.

Currently, the platform logs all access events, but providers are struggling to understand *why* certain patient records were accessed, which makes it difficult to:
- Investigate potential privacy breaches
- Respond to patient requests about who viewed their data
- Train staff on proper data access patterns

## Setup

1. Read through both parts before starting
2. Use a timer to track your time for each part
3. Focus on completing each section fully rather than leaving multiple sections half-done
4. You may use any resources (documentation, internet, etc.)

## Submission

When complete, you should have:
1. A completed design document (Part 1)
2. Modified code with your implementation (Part 2)
3. Any comments explaining your assumptions or trade-offs

## Important Notes

- **Communication matters**: Assume your design doc will be read by both technical and non-technical stakeholders (product managers, compliance officers, engineers)
- **Time management**: It's better to deliver a complete, well-reasoned solution to part of the problem than an incomplete solution to everything
- **Comments**: When you make assumptions or encounter ambiguity, document it in comments
- **Trade-offs**: We care more about your reasoning than the "perfect" solution

Good luck! 🏥
