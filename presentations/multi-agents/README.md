## Creating a Multi-Agent Flow

Ever wondered how AI assistants like Cursor, ChatGPT, or Claude actually work? This talk demystifies AI agents and shows you how to build your own specialized agents from scratch. We'll explore the limitations of current single-agent approaches and demonstrate how to create custom agents with specialized capabilities and output styles.

You'll learn how to orchestrate multiple specialized agents into a powerful multi-agent flow, where each agent brings its own expertise to solve complex problems. Move beyond one-size-fits-all AI assistants and discover how coordinated agent systems can tackle challenges that single agents struggle with.

In this talk I want to demonstrate the following:

1. Explain what "Agents" are
2. How we currently are using agents, either in Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude.
   2.2 Explain their shortcomings
3. How to create you own "Agent" and "Output styles"
4. How each specialized "Agents" can be used independently
5. How using these "Agents" within a Multi-Agent flow can be powerful
