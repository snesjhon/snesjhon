Learning more and more about the algorithms.

It's funny, a lot of the times when I'm in this kind of loop I've gone through so many rabbit holes that I begin to doubt myself.

But at the same time I reflect (after a bunch of studying) that "Hey, maybe I know a thing or two"

That makes sense. Whatever the structure is, if I `.flatten` this array, would I make the same amount of work

Tis came up within one of the [[dfs]] problems,and it makes sense that I would be able to write this in multiple `for of` loops, because _we're only visiting the data once_

It would be different if we were visiting the data multiple times, but we're not. If we visited the data multiple times then we would be writing this in `O(N^2)`
