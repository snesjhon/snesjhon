Going to talk about my experience in preparation for many future questions

## A complex feature you built end-to-end (emphasize full-stack work)

### Front End

- One of my biggest accomplishment was during the migration towards Unified Analytics. Our legacy analytics platform was showing its signs of aging, firstly noted through Component infrastructure. We had many "sections" (aka Marketing, Product, Home) and each of these had "extended" our component (in a sense) they were still using our component, but they were writing so much logic on top of it, that it might as well have been their own custom component
- Our approach was two fold
  - Establish a "source of truth" approach within our section that can be expanded upon by other teams through an Internal Library
  - Establish a "migration path" for each section. If you were starting from scratch how would you deal with implementing our components
- Adoption was slow initially and we had a lot of questions regarding how certain data structures/models would fit within our "source of truth system" but we handled them case by case. What we learned though allowed us to assure that bigger "sections" or "1st party" adopters would have less of a headache when it came time to migrate their system

## Backend

- We didn't necessarily know when _every_ report was going to be migrated to this new system. A blindspot for me was that I wasn't privy to any of the status of data migration at this time, so we did our best to assure that when the data was ready for a specific migration to happen we were ready for this on the front-end side.
- However, one big backend piece of this was to assure that our system was orchestrated in a way that our endpoints were able to have this "hybrid" mode. Knowing that we weren't going to be able to migrate _every_ report we had to support a single report endpoint allowing for both legacy and non-legacy reports. This took a lot of coordination because the new front-end wasn't made for this. We were under the assumption all reports would be ready for this. So creating new endpoint with the right legacy and non-legacy data was essential
- Once this instituted we also to create a lot of maintenance tasks, so that once these reports _were_ migrated, we seamlessly migrated any _extended_ custom report.

  - What performance issue or technical debt did you identify?
  - How did you diagnose and measure the problem?
  - What was your approach to solving it?
  - What were the before/after metrics (load time, throughput, bundle size, etc.)?

  - Did you need to balance tradeoffs (e.g., complexity vs. performance)?
  - How did you roll out the improvement safely?
```

### What performance issue or technical debt did you identify?

- Identifying performance gaps, specifically in the front-end, comes down to seeing the picture in multiple levels of customers. You are not going to see the same kind of performance for the small customers vs the larger customer vs the massive.
- We saw multiple performance gains just by understanding our underlying (pre-chosen) technology Tanstack Query. Working with Claude was a game-changer tbh, it's like validating multiple ideas, never implementing, but validating.
- Of course, nothing was really noticeable within the small merchants, but the large to massive merchants, ANY millisecond improvement meant that certain things would load faster.
- Profiling was another huge steps, specifically front-end profiling, because we had a lot of users that would report these noticeable slowdowns, but we couldn't replicate. Our initial way of tackling these kinds of issues is that we'd deep dive on heap snapshot using our error logger. We had to really dig down an identify certain patterns using dev-tools, and figure out (well, this visualization loads fine for a certain amount of nodes, but once it gets to 10k plus nodes it all fails)

```
  3. Important Architectural Decision

  - What was the decision you needed to make?
  - What were the competing options you considered?
  - How did you evaluate the tradeoffs of each approach?
  - Who else was involved in the decision-making process?
  - What factors ultimately influenced your decision (scalability, maintainability, team expertise)?
  - Looking back, how has that decision held up?
```

```
Problem-solving:

- A time you debugged a challenging issue
- How you've handled production incidents
- Balancing technical debt vs. new features
```

### A time you debugged a challenging issue

- Error logging can be a pain when it doesn't give you any hints into why the Error happened in the first place. Debugging can only happen when you have a good understanding of where to look. It's never great to see an "issue" that needs solving and the best thing you have to go on is "Error was aborted", was does that even mean. You go through the same couple of ideas
  1.  Try to repro
  2.  Try to see the stack
  3.  Try to see if others can repro
  4.  Go through the latest releases and see if anything is related
- If all of those fail, then you're kinda left to wonder how we go here. One such scenario was a front-end issue where we were not properly resolving our promises, we were calling them, putting them on the stack, but weren't resolving because of a multitude of reasons. So the first step in my game plan was to identify and batch them. Which of these came from where, and see what _actually_ deserved our attention and which were noise. Turns out, a lot of it was noise, because naturally when a user quickly enters the browser and then navigates away, we don't have enough time to cancel these promises. So to me, we ignored a certain amount of noise which then reduced the amount of overall "errors" we needed to handle

### Questions

- What does success look like for this role in the first 6 months?
- How is the engineering team structured? Who would I be working most closely with?
- What's the onboarding process like for new engineers?
- How do engineers grow technically here? Any mentorship or learning budget?
- What's the team's approach to staying current with technology?
