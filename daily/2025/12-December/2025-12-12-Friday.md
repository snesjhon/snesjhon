Not the results I was hoping for again, but we persevere.

Yesterday I learned more about [Middle linked list](https://algo.monster/problems/middle_of_linked_list) and it was fun to write and understand.

Given can a linked list find the middle node:

The trick is to create two pointers, one slow and one fast. One that goes through each and one that goes twice as fast. Thus when the fast pointer hits the end, the slow pointer will be in the middle

```ts
function linkedList(head: ListNode){
	let slow = head;
	let fast = head;
	
	while(fast){
	  if(!fast.next) return slow;
	  
	  slow = slow.next ?? null;
	  fast = fast.next.next ?? null;
	}
	
	return slow
}

```
