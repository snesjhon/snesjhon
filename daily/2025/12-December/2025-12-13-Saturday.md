## Learning Python

Feels like a good opportunity to learn a new language to reinforce what I'm learning every day.

Seems like if I could write it in multiple languages, it'll make me think harder about the problem instead of just learning and memorizing the pattern.

I think that makes sense in a big way since I want to strengthen both sides. I don't think I want to continue learning more rails. Feels like the way of the world is moving towards python.
