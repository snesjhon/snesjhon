Overall, I think it went alright. The take home took a toll as to how quickly I was able to answer everything and I think I felt overwhelmed with getting something right than looking at every requirement.

I also spent too much time looking to have _an_ answer to every task than refortifying whether the answers I had on each section where completely done.
